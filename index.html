  <p>The Selkirk Rex is a medium-large sized cat. They are often referred to as "the cat in sheep's clothing", due to their wavy/curly fur, that ranges from long-short. They have round heads, large eyes, and pointed ears, 
   which make them stand out from other curly-coated cat breeds. They are quite rare, since the breed was developed in the 1980s. They have a gentle and laidback disposition, which makes them a popular cat to buy.
