  <p>The Selkirk Rex is a medium-large sized cat. They are often referred to as "the cat in sheep's clothing", due to their wavy/curly fur, that ranges from long-short. 
     They have round heads, large eyes, and pointed ears, which make them stand out from other curly-coated cat breeds. They are quite rare, since the breed was developed 
     in the 1980s. They have a gentle and laidback disposition, which makes them a popular cat to buy.</p>

      <p> The first Selkirk Rex was born in Montana, to a rescue cat. This kitten was different to all the other ones in the litter, because she had unusually curly fur. This kitten 
     was given to the breeder, Jeri Newman, who named her Miss DiPesto, after a curly-haired TV character. All Selkirk Rex are descendants of Miss DiPesto. Jeri Newman named the 
     breed after her stepfather "Selkirk".</p>
